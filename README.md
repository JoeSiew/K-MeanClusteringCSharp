K-Mean Clustering - Language C#

## Solve the following question

Table 1 below shows the simulated results for four subjects (Chemistry, History, Biology, Chinese) of
24 students in a secondary school in first semester. You are hired by the school to perform a grouping
of the students based on the mark for these 24 students in order for the school to design different
curriculum for different group of students in subsequent semesters. Table 2 shows the results for
another 9 students in the second semester. You have to advise the school to group these students into
groups that you have discovered. In third semester, another 4 students, as shown in Table 3, you have
to group them accordingly as well by using data from table 2 and table 1.
